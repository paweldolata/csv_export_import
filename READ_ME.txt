All tasks were made on computer with Windows system, using IntelliJ Idea 2016.1.2 Version. It was also tested on this device,
but it should work on Linux system without problem as well. All output files are generated in main project folder directory.
Program is started with --top 5 for example, so in main function arguments, which are our resources, are moved to the right.
Program can be run with one argument.Writing to csv file is released in simple way with built tools, but there is a possibility
to make it shorter with external library. Frankly speaking I didn't include test code, because I have never done it before
and I don't know how it is to implement good test code.
